<h1>Fractallist</h1>
<p>What is a fractallist? It's a word I coined a while back. It means someone who interacts with fractals, similarly to someone who does science is called a scientist.<br>I don't really have a name that would stick. Just call me Eli or 42 if you need to refer to me and you don't have my current name preference.<br>
My pronouns change but they/them would probably make the most sense for when you are not sure.<br>
On discord I usually use proxy bots or change my display name to better fit my needs for self expression.</p>
